v0.2.8  --  2012.01.22
Fixed requireFirstInTree for Windows

v0.2.7  --  2012.01.22
Windows support, for everything apart child_process/pipe.js
Modules now return paths with directory separators for current environment.
Added two functions:
* path/normalize - It's same as Node.js however it always returns paths with
  separators for given environment and always strips slashes
* path/separator - Returns directory separator for current environment

v0.2.6  --  2012.01.21
New functions:
* fs/filesAtPath - Return all files at path (if path is file return itself if
  it's a directory return all files in directory)
* fs/readdirDirectory - Return list of all directories in given directory
* path/endWithSlash - Return path ended with slash

Improved:
* Use lstat instead of stat in most functions (to avoid inifite recursion with
  symbolic links)
* findPackageRoot - cache resolved root paths
* readdirFilesDeep - Do not crash on not accessible files

General:
* Updated dependencies to newest versions
* Added Travis CI Configuration

v0.2.5  --  2012.01.17
* Improved getRequire logic so it doesn't need to create temporary files in
  module path. Currently it relies on internal Node.js API.

v0.2.4  --  2011.12.22
* requireFirstInTree - method for requiring first named module found up in the
  directory tree

v0.2.3  --  2011.08.12
* findPackageRoot: Now folder that resides in 'node_modules' is accepted as
  package root, it's not that compliant with npm, but node works that way

v0.2.2  --  2011.08.11
* Fixed path.trim (it trimmed root path ('/') to empty string)
* Fixed getRequire, it now returns require as returned by node, and works in all
  node versions

v0.2.1  --  2011.08.08
* Added TAD test suite to devDependencies, configured test commands.
  Tests can be run with 'make test' or 'npm test'

v0.2.0  --  2011.08.08
New functions:
* requireSilent, getRequire, isModuleNotFoundError, requireInContext
* fs: readdirFilesDeep, copy, copySync

Improvements
* Renamed getPackageRoot into findPackageRoot
* Compatibility with es5-ext v0.6
* Test with TAD

v0.1.1  --  2011.07.11
* node engine compatibility info (package.json)

v0.1.0  --  2011.07.11
Initial version
