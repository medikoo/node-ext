v0.2.5  --  2012.01.17
* Improved getRequire logic so it doesn't need to create temporary files in module path.
  Currently it relies on internal Node.js API.

* requireFirstInTree - method for requiring first named module found up in the directory tree

v0.2.3  --  2011.08.12
* findPackageRoot: Now folder that resides in 'node_modules' is accepted as
  package root, it's not that compliant with npm, but node works that way

v0.2.2  --  2011.08.11
* Fixed path.trim (it trimmed root path ('/') to empty string)
* Fixed getRequire, it now returns require as returned by node, and works in all
  node versions

* Added TAD test suite to devDependencies, configured test commands.
  Tests can be run with 'make test' or 'npm test'
